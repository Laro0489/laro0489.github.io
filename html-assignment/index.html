            <p>I am Shyleigh Larocque a student who just figured out how to get my visual studio code to work with my github account despite being halfway through the semester. I am 20 years old and im from a small reserve in Quebec. I have never been much of a track star, sometimes being behind does't always mean that youre last.
            </p>
            <p> On my free time I spend a lot of time playing video games and creating content on literally every social media (Youtube,Twitch,Tiktok,Twitter,Hover,Instagram). I am not financially able to do this full time just yet but i am able to pay some bills by doing this which i am extremely grateful for. Thats all there is to know about me.</p>
